Q. Install Iconv package

Downloaded and installed iconv-1.19 in c:\iconv.
Collected package iconv-0.4.0.2 thus (just in case adding ways in INCLUDE and LIB):


runhaskell Setup configure --extra-include-dirs=c:\iconv\include --extra-lib-dirs=c:\iconv\lib 
runhaskell Setup build 
runhaskell Setup install
