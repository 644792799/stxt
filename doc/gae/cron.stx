Q.Possible to Schedule a Cron Job for Specific Day of Every Month 
  on Google App Engine?

It appears this currently is not possible, though I still don't know for certain.

Thus, my work around is to setup a cronjob to run every day, and have the method it's calling return early if it's not the 27th. ~29 extra requests per day isn't that bad, right?
