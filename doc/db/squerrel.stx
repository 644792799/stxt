Q.howto use explain plan oracle?
I've used it without problems. Just click on the Explain Plan Tab,
when you're at the SQL Entry Area and Run your SQL. If you havent got
a PLAN_TABLE created, SQuirreL will ask permission to create one. The
meaning of the output is Oracle specific, so you must on the online
Oracle docs for further information.
